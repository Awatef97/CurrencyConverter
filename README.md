currency App designed to help users manage multi-currency conversions.

I implement this task using: *Kotlin* and following *Model-view-viewModel (MVVM)* architecture pattern that follows *separation of concerns*.
Also by applying *Clean Architecture* to ensure maintainable and scalable systems.

The following technologies are used:

- ViewModel to manage UI-related data in a lifecycle conscious way.
- Dagger-hilt library to do dependency injection and reducing the boilerplate code.
- Kotlin coroutines for doing work on the background thread and communicating to the main thread.
- Operators are used to give control on and manipulating the emitted flows.
- Retrofit library to make api requests.
- Room for caching.
- DataBinding to bind views
